# Predict-Sales-Price

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and processing real estate sales data, and building predictive models to forecast property prices. The project involves several steps, starting with data cleaning, performing statistical analysis, and developing machine learning models like Linear Regression and Decision Tree to compare their performance in predicting prices.
